# Highlighting code blocks in markdown

- Inline `code` has back-ticks (`) around it.

- Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. Only the fenced code blocks support syntax highlighting!

Examples:

This code is enclosed by lines with three back-ticks (```):

```python
def print_hello():
    s = "Hello world!"
    print s

print_hello()
```

This code is indented by four spaces:

    def print_hello():
        s = "Hello world!"
        print s

    print_hello()

**Small note**: Press the spacebar once after typing the back-tick to make it appear on screen.
