# Highlighting code blocks in markdown

- Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

- Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. Only the fenced code blocks support syntax highlighting!

Example:

```python
def print_hello():
    s = "Hello world!"
    print s

print_hello()
```
