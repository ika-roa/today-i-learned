# Extract code to Python package

Use JupyterLab only for integrating code from your package and keep complex functionality inside the package. Thus, extract larger bits of code from a notebook and move it into a package or directly develop code in a proper IDE

1.  Write prototype code in notebook
2.  Transform code to functions / classes
3.  Test new classes / functions inside the notebook
4.  directly extract and move it into a module within the package src/ folder
5.  Now it can be imported and used inside the notebook
